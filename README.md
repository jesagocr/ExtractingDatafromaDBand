# Python4ECapstone_PocketData

This is a practice of the course: https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data-visualization

I lernt about sqlite3, Dbbrowser, basic SQL, API (post a request) and the existence of d3.layout.cloud.

I have to learn about Javascript and regular expresions. 

You can download many scripts and practice-learn here: https://www.py4e.com/code3.zip or just the code I used to practice https://www.py4e.com/code3/gmane.zip

The idea is, to extract data and vizualize it (understand it). I like pocket (https://getpocket.com/) to save web pages and I wanted to try with this. 
What I did: 
Use the api of Pocket to download the data. 
Create a Database to save my data. 
Extrac the data and create a file.js to create a word cloud in the browser.
